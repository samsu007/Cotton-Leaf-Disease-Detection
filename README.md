"# Cotton-Leaf-Disease-Detection" 

Here we Classify the images using VGG16 and VGG19 models

VGG16 is giving better accuracy than VGG19 in this dataset

VGG16 model - ~91% accuracy

VGG19 model - ~89% accuracy

Step By Step Process :

1. first import required libraries and packages
2. read the dataset
3. Preprocessing the image using (ImageDataGenerator) method
4. plot some visualiztion of the images
5. initialize the model
6. compile the model
7. fit the model
8. predict the model
9. plot the confusion matrix
